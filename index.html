            Like you, I have lost weight and gained it back. I have started exercise programs and not stuck to them. But, in 1979, I lost weight and have kept it off since then.
            If you also have tried to lead a healthy lifestyle and found your efforts didn’t work in the past, I have GOOD NEWS! Because I have found that the “secret” to maintaining a healthy lifestyle is HAVING FUN!
            Success comes through having fun!
            Isn’t that great? The reason that the diet or exercise or lifestyle program didn’t work in the past is because you weren’t having fun at it! Is losing weight, exercising, and maintaining healthy habits a lot of work? Of course it is! That’s why it’s doubly important to have as much fun as you can while you’re doing it, because if it’s not fun, you’re not going to do it! Right? Right!</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4"><h5>The motto that inspires me is: “Do one thing every day that makes you happy!” Why? Because when you participate in activities that are FUN for you, you’ll stick with them! When you find nutritional, healthy foods that you enjoy, you’ll eat them! When you are spending your time on FUN activities, you won’t have the time to be stressed (and you’ll avoid emotional eating)!
            Check out the book and see!
            (Contains information and links to use to build your own weight loss plan!)

            <div class="text"><h5>Need a food diary? The 12-week (Universal Food Diary) or 6-week (My Food Diary) diet journal is adaptable to almost any diet. Whatever you’re tracking—calories, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, or other units—this food tracker has a place for it. You can also record your activity or mood. At the beginning of every week, there’s a space to record your weight and/or measurements (bust/chest, waist, hips, arms, legs), your goals for the week, and any notes. There’s also a space for you to plan fun activities for the week. (Yes, you need to take time to have fun on your diet!). In addition, there’s a page of helpful hints for following a weight loss program.
            More than one research study has shown that keeping track of what you eat is essential in a weight-loss program. So track your food—the results may astound you!</h5></div>

    <div><h2>Joan's Story<h2></div>
    <img src="http://weightlosssuccessbook.com/before.jpg" alt="Joan before weight loss" width="200" height="300" /></a>
    <p>I was a chubby kid from the beginning. (My Mom told me that when I was a baby, all I wanted to do was eat.) One day when I was in elementary school, a neighbor came over and told me, “Joan, if you get any fatter, you’ll be rolling down hills.” [Photos: top - Joan before losing weight; bottom - Joan after losing weight]</p>
    <p>When I was in high school, I lost weight by counting calories. In college, I was a reasonable weight. But in graduate school, the student cafeteria offered unlimited seconds. I had always had a rampaging appetite, but my parents wouldn’t let me eat all I wanted. Now that I was away from my parents, I did eat all I wanted–though I found I always wanted more. I had heard that there was a point that, if you ate enough, you wouldn’t want any more. I never reached that point: then, or since.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t aware that I had gained a lot of weight until my best friend’s wedding, when I didn’t fit into the formal made for me in high school. It had to be let out, and even then, I resembled a sausage stuffed in too small a roll.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 1979, I joined a popular weight loss program. When I joined, I thought I would lose all the weight right away. Instead, it took me months. (July 1979 was “hell month.” I was so hungry I was irritable, bouncing off the walls, and almost ready to eat paint off the walls! I toughed it out and stuck to the program and eventually the intense hunger pangs subsided.) I reached my goal when I was vacationing in England and went for a weekly weigh-in.</p>
    <img src="http://weightlosssuccessbook.com/jmvphoto.jpg" alt="Joan after weight loss" width="200" height="250" /></a>
    <p>I completed the weight loss program on October 28, 1979. I thought when I started that I would just lose the weight and then go back to the way I was eating before, thinking (magically) that once I was thin, I could still overeat and remain thin, so the first thing I did after I completed the program was bake a batch of brownies and ate the batch. That was my wake-up call. I stayed on the maintenance program voluntarily for an entire year to make the lifestyle changes that I needed to make in order to keep the weight off permanently. I was determined never to gain it back and vowed never to put myself through “hell month” again.  I have kept the weight off since 1979 and have never been more than 2 pounds over my goal weight since then (and I have 35 years of weigh-in books to prove it!). I am a member of the National Weight Control Registry (a registry of people who have lost at least 30 pounds–30 pounds over your ideal weight is the medical definition of obesity–and have kept it off for at least a year).</p>
    <p>What I have found is this: losing weight is hard work. The harder you work, the more successful you will be. If you weigh and measure everything, write down everything you eat, and stick with the basics of the program, you will lose weight.</p>
    <p>Once you have lost the weight, keeping it off is a matter of lifestyle. It’s important to learn to deal with stress, emotions, etc. without turning to food. Realize that you will ALWAYS want more food than it takes to maintain your current (lower) weight. Maintenance isn’t necessarily easy, but with practice, it can become automatic.</p>
    <p>Losing my weight in 1979 was one of the smartest things I’ve done in my life. Because I’ve been at a healthy weight all these years, I’ve avoided a lot of nasty health problems. And that has motivated me to keep the weight off, permanently.</p>
